GOAL
1. Sink the computer ships in the fewest number of guess, got the rating or level on how well you perform,

SETUP
1. Computer placed 3 DotComs on virtual 7 x 7 grid.
    (2 Dimension) -> (1 Dimension) [1 x 7] => area[7] => [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
    DotCom dotCom = new DotCom(1,2,3)
    BattleField battleField = new BattleField() | area => [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    battleField.addDotCom(dotCom)
        battleField area => [0,1,1,1,0,0,0]

2. Ask player to guess.
    prompt to player

HOW TO PLAY
1. Computer prompt to enter guess.
    Prompt to player
2. Player guess a cell.
    playerGuessedPosition = 1
3. Player will got response "Hit", "Miss", "You sunk [DotCom.name]".
    battleField.hit(playerGuessedPosition)
        if area[1] == 1 =>(response "Hit") area[1] = 0
                DotCom at that position become sunk dotCom.hit(position)
                    DotCom position that got hit changed to -1 => positions[-1,2,3]
                    check if all position is -1 => isSink is true then (response "You sunk DotCom.name")
        if area[1] == 0 =>(response "Miss")
4. If all DotComs is gone the game end.
    battleField.isDotComExist()
    check all DotCom if all isSink return false else true
